bitcointesting.org
==================

This will hopefully become an easy way for the masses to grab beta binaries of the Satoshi client.

The flow is as follows:

1. User goes tot bitcointesting.org

2. User selects a pull request they want to test

3. User clicks download 

4. User posts on the dev forum that they gave it a spin and it made them happy

It would be nice to really flesh this out, have operating system choices, links to the pull request being downloaded,
mix-and-match pull requests. Maybe this could turn into a place where users could pick which features they want
for their satoshi client. 

User 1: "I want a bloom-filtered, relay-node with double-spend detection."

User 2: "Nah man, get the super-node with network connection toggle"
